This was created to make obfuscated scripts more palatable. However, it should be a nice addition to your web development tasks.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install esformatter-var-each`

Then, register it as a plugin and format your JS

```js
var esformatter = require('esformatter');

```
